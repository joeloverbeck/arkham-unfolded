//! Agent seat (#153): the game-neutral half. An agent sits at the real table through one
//! JSON request per line and one JSON response per line, with no window: on standard
//! input and output in batch form, or held across shell commands on a local socket
//! ([`socket`], #175). This module owns the windowless host, fixed-step stepping,
//! pointer and key synthesis, capture and the protocol loop both forms share. It reaches
//! the game only through [`Game`]: produce an observation and its revision, resolve a
//! name to a screen position (and a hit back to a name), say what has keyboard focus,
//! and report whether the table is settled. The host's surface and the capture of its
//! image come from `unfolded-tabletop`; when a capture may start, and on which clock,
//! stay here.
//!
//! The protocol's guards live here, so every transport gets them (#175): activations and
//! keys act only on the revision they were decided on, a key that can commit presses
//! only the control it names, and a connection stops acting after its first refusal or
//! missed activation.
//!
//! Input enters where Bevy's own window-event conversion writes it: `PointerInput` and
//! `KeyboardInput` messages plus the logical window's cursor position. Everything after
//! that is production code. The seat never triggers observers, queues table actions or
//! calls handlers.
