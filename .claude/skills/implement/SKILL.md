Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Before fetching a ticket or reading startup documents, follow the repository's [tracker and bounded-reading procedure](../../../docs/agents/issue-tracker.md#bounded-context-reads). If the user passes a ticket reference, fetch it and state its title before starting. If the reference is ambiguous, ask.

Before editing, record the starting commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`) and working-tree status (`git status --short --untracked-files=all`). Preserve any pre-existing edits to paths the task will touch so they remain distinguishable from this task's changes.

Call the Skill tool with "tdd" where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, call the Skill tool with "code-review", passing the starting commit, the originating issue/spec and **working-tree review** as the candidate mode. Identify the task's changed and new files and any pre-existing edits outside its scope. Follow that skill's candidate-capture procedure before committing.

Commit your work to the current branch.
